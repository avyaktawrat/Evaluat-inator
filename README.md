### - Content based recommendation system.
First, the system executes a model-building stage by finding the similarity between all pairs of items. This similarity function can take many forms, such as correlation between ratings or cosine of those rating vectors.
Second, the system executes a recommendation stage. It uses the most similar items to a user's already-rated items to generate a list of recommendations.

### - Collaborative recommendation system
A user expresses his or her preferences by rating items (e.g. books, movies or CDs) of the system. These ratings can be viewed as an approximate representation of the user's interest in the corresponding domain.
The system matches this user's ratings against other users' and finds the people with most "similar" tastes.
With similar users, the system recommends items that the similar users have rated highly but not yet being rated by this user.
